I want to create an over-the-shoulder 3D multiplayer horror game using BabylonJS and PartyKit. The app will be hosted on Vercel and be invite-only, for me and my friends to play. Use the follwoing details when building your plan: 

- The visual style should be similar to Quake 1. 
- it should not require account creation (only player names). 
- 2-4 players are spawned into a 3D forest and must run from one end of a rectanuglar map to the other while be pursued by a monster. 
- If a player is caught by the monstor, they must endure an very annowing conversation via a text chat. The game pauses for other players as well and they watch the text chat. 
- The player who is caught must win an arugment with the monster or they will be eaten. If they win, they are freed and the chase resumes. they can still be caught again 
- The game continues until all players are eaten or reach the other end of the map.
- Players who are eaten observe the monster
- The game should have AI players if the lobby isn't full with humans.

I will eventually want the monster's chat to be enabled with a Azure Foundry chat LLM. If it's better to add that later in the dev process, that's okay

I want to test the game for myself and make sure all features work and the look/feel is good before fully implementing multiplayer. I may want to iterate on feastures before inviting my friends to try it.

Provide a list of all .env variables I should gather for the app to work, and create a template .env file for me to fill in
